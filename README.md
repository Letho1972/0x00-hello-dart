What is dart?

Dart is a programming language developed by Google, designed for building web,
mobile, and desktop applications. It's especially well-suited for client-side development,
meaning itâ€™s great for creating applications with rich, interactive user interfaces.

Where Dart is Used?

Dart is most well-known as the primary language for Flutter,
but it can also be used independently for backend and web applications,
thanks to the Dart VM and dart2js, a compiler that converts Dart code to JavaScript.

How to Run:

dart <filename.dart
